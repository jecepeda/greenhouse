# IOT

This folder contains the code necessary to be run inside an ESP32.

## Things to run

- PlatformIO
- VSCode
- ESP32

## Setup

Go to [Credentials.hpp](src/Credentials.hpp) and create a file called `Credentials.cpp` and implement all the functions needed, since they're like the .env variables for the ESP32.

Finally, run the code on vscode.
